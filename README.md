### Test for Tandem (jQuery version)

Demonstration of the following functionality:

This app was made to demonstrate the implementation of two features: loading the next page of images when user reaches the bottom of the page, and the reflowable rendering of the responsive image gallery.

Major Details:

- jQuery (for AJAX)
- Mustache for templating
- Bootstrap for styling

I certainly would have implemented all the major features found on the demo site if I had the time (e.g. image search, collapsible sidebar, etc).
